    	<h1>Contribution Guide</h1>
    	<p>Grommet is divided into a few projects.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet" target="_blank">grommet</a> - the primary Grommet project
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet-bower" target="_blank">grommet-bower</a> - the Bower distribution of Grommet
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/html-jsx-loader" target="_blank">html-jsx-loader</a> - a html loader module to convert HTML to JSX for Webpack used as part of the documentation
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Contributing</h2>
			<p>The best way to collaborate with the project contributors is through GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet" target="_blank">https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you want to contribute design assets or style guide revisions, please open a <a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet/pulls" target="_blank">GitHub pull request</a> or open a <a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you want to contribute code by either fixing a problem or creating a new feature, please open a <a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet/pulls" target="_blank">GitHub pull request</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you want to raise an issue such as a defect or an enhancement request please open a <a href="https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a> while keeping the following in mind:
					<ul>
						<li>Try to reduce your code to the bare minimum required to reproduce the issue.</li>
						<li>If we can't reproduce the issue, we can't fix it. Please list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue. Include versions of your OS, browser, Node.js, etc. Include relevant logs or sample code.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that all patches from all contributors get reviewed.</p>

			<p>After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If the patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.</p>

			<p>When a pull request for code contributions fails testing, the author is expected to update the pull request to address the failure until it passes testing and the pull request merges successfully.</p>

			<p>At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches (even patches from maintainers).</p>

		<h3>Developer's Certificate of Origin</h3>

			<p>All contributions must include acceptance of the DCO:</p>

			<p>By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:</p>

			<p>(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or</p>

			<p>(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or</p>

			<p>(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.</p>

			<p>(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.</p>

		<h3>Sign your work</h3>
		<p>To accept the DCO, simply add this line to each commit message with your name and email address (git commit -s will do this for you):</p>

		<pre><code>Signed-off-by: Jane Example &lt;jane@example.com&gt;</code></pre>

		<p>For legal reasons, no anonymous or pseudonymous contributions are accepted.</p>

		<h2>Design Contributions</h2>
		<p>The Grommet community values contributions on the design side of the project.  The Grommet style guide and designer assets are open for contributions just as the development platform.  You may either submit an issue on GitHub with a detailed recommendation, or open a pull request with the updated assets.</p>


		<h2>Other Ways to Contribute</h2>
		<p>If you don't feel like creating design assets or writing code, you can still contribute to the project!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				You may submit updates and improvements to the documentation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Submit articles and guides which are also part of the documentation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Help a Grommet designer or developer by answering questions on StackOverflow, Slack and GitHub.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Submitting Code Pull Requests</h2>

		<p>We encourage and support contributions from the community. No fix is too small. We strive to process all pull requests as soon as possible and with constructive feedback. If your pull request is not accepted at first, please try again after addressing the feedback you received.

		<p>To make a pull request you will need a GitHub account. For help, see GitHub's documentation on forking and pull requests.</p>

		<p>All pull requests with code should include tests that validate your change.</p>

		<h2>Code Syntax</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Two space indents. Don't use tabs anywhere. Use \t if you need a tab character in a string.
			</li>
			<li>
				No trailing whitespace, except in markdown files where a line break must be forced.
			</li>
			<li>
				Don't go overboard with the whitespace.
			</li>
			<li>
				No more than one assignment per var statement.
			</li>
			<li>
				Delimit strings with single-quotes ', not double-quotes ".
			</li>
			<li>
				Prefer if and else to "clever" uses of ? : conditional or ||, && logical operators.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use a multi-line /* */ comment block early in a file as needed to describe the design of the module. Use inline // comments elsewhere as needed to clarify implementation details.
			</li>
			<li>
				When in doubt, follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
			</li>
		</ol>
