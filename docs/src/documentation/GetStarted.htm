      <h1>Get Started</h1>
      <p>
        This section aims to provide you with assets to quickly get the Grommet framework running. You'll find recommendations for your application's structure, development, testing, static code analysis, and deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grommet is in the early stages of development. As of this moment, Grommet is not deployed in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a> or <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a>. This means that early evaluators must build Grommet in their local environment.  Once Grommet is publicly released, this step will be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, don&#39;t forget to <a href="../request_access">Request Access</a> to the source code if you haven&#39;t done so.  This is also a temporary step that is only required while the repository is private on GitHub.
      </p>

      <h2>Building Grommet</h2>
      <p>
        To build Grommet you must first install <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, and <a href="http://gulpjs.com" target="_blank">Gulp</a>. Then run the following commands to publish Grommet in your local npm: 
      </p>
      <pre><code class="bash">
        {'git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet.git\ncd grommet\ngulp dist # This command generates a production version of Grommet.\ncd dist\nnpm link # This command links the production dist to your local NPM.'}
      </code></pre>
      <p>You can now start a new project and link that to Grommet:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">
        mkdir sample-app
        <br/>
        cd sample-app
        <br/>
        npm link grommet
      </code></pre>
      <p>A <i>node_modules</i> folder will be created which contains a symbolic link to Grommet from your local environment.</p>
