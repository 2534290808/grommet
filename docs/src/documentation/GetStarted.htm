      <h1>Get Started</h1>
      <p>
        This section aims to provide you with assets to quickly get Grommet framework up-and-running. We will recommend good practices on application structure, development, testing, static code analysis, and deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grommet is developed on top of <a href="http://reactjs.com" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> which provides great features in JavaScript for building user interfaces.
        We are also using a JavaScript syntax extension called <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html" target="_blank">JSX</a>. To enable front-end routing paths we are using <a href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router">React Router</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We expect that you have at least a basic understading on these technologies to be able to master Grommet, in addition to JavaScript of course. In terms of styling (css), Grommet already provides everything you need to quickly create great applications based on our application <a href="/#/styleguide">Style Guide</a>. Under the hood, we are using <a href="http://inuitcss.com/" target="_blank">InuitCSS</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> to compile our stylesheets. But, don&#39;t worry too much here, we are not expecting you to write a lot of CSS code. After all, why reinventing the wheel?
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, Grommet is in early stages of development. As of this moment, we are not deployed in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a>. This means that you, as an early evaluator, must build Grommet in your local environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don&#39;t forget to <a href="#/request_access">Request Access</a> to the source code if you haven&#39;t done so.

      <h2>Building Grommet</h2>
      <p>
        To build Grommet is a prerequisite to install <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Then run the following commands to publish Grommet in your local npm: 
      </p>
      <pre><code class="bash">
        git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet.git
        <br/>
        cd grommet
        <br/>
        npm link
      </code></pre>
      <p>You can now start a new project and link that to Grommet:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">
        mkdir sample-app
        <br/>
        cd sample-app
        <br/>
        npm link grommet
      </code></pre>
      <p>A <i>node_modules</i> folder will be created which contains Grommet bits from your local environment.</p>
