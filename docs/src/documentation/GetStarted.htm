      <h1>Get Started</h1>
      <p>
        This section aims to provide you with assets to quickly get Grommet framework up-and-running. We will recommend good practices on application structure, development, testing, static code analysis, and deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, Grommet is in early stages of development. As of this moment, we are not deployed in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a>. This means that you, as an early evaluator, must build Grommet in your local environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don&#39;t forget to <a href="#/request_access">Request Access</a> to the source code if you haven&#39;t done so.

      <h2>Building Grommet</h2>
      <p>
        To build Grommet is a prerequisite to install <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Then run the following commands to publish Grommet in your local npm: 
      </p>
      <pre><code class="bash">
        git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/grommet.git
        <br/>
        cd grommet
        <br/>
        npm link
      </code></pre>
      <p>You can now start a new project and link that to Grommet:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">
        mkdir sample-app
        <br/>
        cd sample-app
        <br/>
        npm link grommet
      </code></pre>
      <p>A <i>node_modules</i> folder will be created which contains Grommet bits from your local environment.</p>
