          <li>Adding, removing, editing, and completing tasks</li>
          <li>Managing labels and assigning them to tasks</li>
          <li>Searching for existing tasks and/or labels</li>
          <li>Filtering tasks by status (completed, in progress, created) and/or labels</li>
          <li>Login and Logout operations</li>
        </ul>
