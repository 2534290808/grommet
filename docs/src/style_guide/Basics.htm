    <h1>Basics</h1>

    <p>Here you will find the core elements for the application style guide.
    The downloadable assets contain these core elements. Checkboxes, buttons,
    status icons and more are all described in these assets.
    Rather than documenting these in gory detail, we thought you would
    appreciate the brevity. We also think you really just want to see them anyway,
    so why waste your time?</p>

    <h2>Color</h2>
    <div class="generic-branding">
      <p>These are the generic, or un-branded, colors. It is expected that
        applications will define their own brand color scheme.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hpe-branding">
    <p>The HP Experience color palette is utilized in applications for the
    most part. However there are variances in the palette that apply specifically
    to applications.</p>

    <p>For application design the color orange should not be used as an accent
    color. The reason being that the highly salient orange is closely associated
    with red which is a color which indicates a critical status. The red color is
    reserved for resources that need immediate attention. </p>

    <p>Similarly, the HP Experience green accent color should not be used because
    it is reserved for status icons that refer to resources that are in a normal
    state.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Text</h2>
    <p>Text and Typography is arguably one of the most important elements of
    style to get right. Ironically, when done well the text styles and typography
    disappear from the users consciousness and they simply enjoy the beautiful
    and fluid experience. However, when done poorly, the typography can be a
    reason an application just doesn’t feel right. Everything from displeasing
    aesthetics, to unclear organization of information, to physical eye strain
    can result from an application with insufficient attention to this detail.</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>Applications use the <a class="generic-branding" href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a>
    <span class="hpe-branding">Metric</span> font in prominent areas
    such as headings, subheadings, login screens and titles. For the remaining
    body copy, tables, labels, values, and so on, the Arial font is used. The
    typographic scale and styles can be found in the attached assets.</p>
    <div class="font-sample primary">Primary font sample</div>
    <div class="font-sample base">Basic font sample</div>

    <h3>Writing Style</h3>
    <p>Applications should use a conversational tone and should not include
    excessive technical jargon.</p>

    <p>Here are some things we recommend you consider when writing for applications:</p>

    <h3>Do’s</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use simple yet complete sentences.</li>
      <li>Use correct punctuation.</li>
      <li>Use the present tense to describe problem states.</li>
      <li>Use past tense to describe events that occurred in the past.</li>
      <li>Use an active voice whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Passive voice is acceptable to describe some error conditions.</li>
      <li>Use descriptors clarify terminology. For example, “Specify InflD
      when Detect is set to NO.” We instead recommend something along the
      lines of “Specify the InflD parameter when the Detect option is set
      to NO”.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Don’ts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not use UPPERCASE in text or exclamation points!!!!</li>
      <li>Do not make the user feel at fault.</li>
      <li>Do not anthropomorphize by implying that the programs or hardware
      can think or feel.</li>
      <li>Do not use colloquial words or phrases.</li>
      <li>Do not use terms that may be offensive in certain cultures.</li>
      <li>Do not compound several nouns without adding a preposition or
      subclause to clarify the meaning. For example, “Site Server LDAP
      Service directory server” should be changed to “Directory server for
      the LDAP Service of the Site Server”.</li>
      <li>Avoid the use of the word “bad”. Use more descriptive terms to
      tell the user as to what is wrong. For example, avoid messages such
      as “Bad size”. Instead, tell the user what criteria to use when
      specifying a size.</li>
      <li>Avoid the use of the word “please”. It can imply that a required
      action is optional.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Date and Time</h3>
    <p>Date and time formats should generally be displayed in the user’s
    local timezone.  Any exceptions to this should include the timezone being
    used to display the time and date. In addition, dates and times shall always
    be localized to use the most recognizable format for the user’s locale.
    Here are examples of recommended date and time formats. Notice, that we use
    words like “Today” and “Yesterday” as it doesn’t force the user to remember
    today’s date to process the information.  In each of these examples, showing
    seconds is optional.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Today, since 12:00 am today:
        <ul>
          <li><code>Today &lt;HH:MM[:SS] am|pm&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>Today 10:10:05 am</code></li>
          <li><code>Today 11:11 am</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Yesterday, since 12:00 am yesterday, before 12:00 am today:
        <ul>
          <li><code>Yesterday &lt;HH:MM[:SS] am|pm&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>Yesterday 10:10:05 pm</code></li>
          <li><code>Yesterday 11:11 am</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>This year, since 12:00 am this year, before yesterday:
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;3 char month name&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;HH:MM[:SS] am/pm&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>Jan 28 10:10:05 am</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Last years messages, before 12:00 am this year:
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;month&gt; &lt;day&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;HH:MM[:SS] am/pm&gt;</code></li>
          <li>1/1/2011 10:10:05 am</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Capitalization</h3>
    <p>For the English language, we recommend using English title capitalization
    rules for titles (i.e. generally, capitalize first letter of each word). Titles
    include the following user interface elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Page titles</li>
      <li>Panel titles</li>
      <li>Section headings</li>
      <li>Form section titles</li>
      <li>Table headers</li>
      <li>Dialog titles (reference rule #8: grammarbook.com)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sentence Capitalization</h4>
    <p>Capitalize only the first letter of data labels unless a word used in the
    data label otherwise deserves capitalization because of English capitalization
    rules (e.g. proper names, abbreviations, etc).</p>

    <p>Data labels include the following UI elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Radio button labels</li>
      <li>Checkbox labels</li>
      <li>Form property labels</li>
      <li>Panel property labels</li>
      <li>Button labels</li>
      <li>Action menu items</li>
      <li>Hyperlinks to actions</li>
      <li>Hint text</li>
      <li>Help text</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Attributes</h4>
    <p>Capitalize only the first letter of attributes unless a word used in
    the attribute otherwise deserves capitalization because of English
    capitalization rules (e.g. proper names, abbreviations, etc). User-entered
    attributes will retain the user’s capitalization.</p>

    <h4>Exceptions</h4>
    <p>The English language is full of exceptions, so we felt compelled.
    For attribute values which indicate the property or data field hasn’t
    been set or the location is intentionally left empty, we use the
    non-capitalized words or phrases such as “empty”, “none”, “not set”,
    “unassigned”, or “no alerts”.</p>

    <p>Some specific words and acronyms are always capitalized for branding
    or common industry recognition.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>VLAN</li>
      <li>IPv4</li>
      <li>IPv6</li>
      <li>WWN</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Capitalization in APIs</h4>
    <p>Yes, our application users make use of our API’s, so it’s important
    to provide a familiar voice to our users, regardless of the interface
    they are using.</p>

    <h5>PascalCase</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Schema names</li>
      <li>Schema enum values</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>camelCase</h5>
    <p>The following API elements should be rendered in camelCase:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Schema attribute names</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grid</h2>
    <p>A grid is the cornerstone of user interface design.  It provides
    alignment and negative space in your application.  The downloadable
    assets contain the recommended grid sizes and layouts.</p>
