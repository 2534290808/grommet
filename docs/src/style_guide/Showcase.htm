    <h1>Showcase</h1>
    <p>The showcase offers a set of application designs that embody the elements of this
    style guide and implementation platform.  Each example in the showcase demonstrates
    a unique approach to meeting a user need.  You'll notice that while the examples in the
    showcase express unique value and differentiated capabilities, they are grounded in common
    interaction patterns and are aligned with a common brand.
