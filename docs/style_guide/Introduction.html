  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>This application style guide was created by the designers at
     Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  The guide covers the general design
     principles as well as specific design guidlines.  You'll also find
     downloadable assets for the basic elements of the appliation style.
     These are meant to help designers quickly begin designing applications
     based on these styles and patterns.  Finally, we've also created a
     web-based development platform that enables developers to quickly begin
     implementing enterprise applications.</p>
