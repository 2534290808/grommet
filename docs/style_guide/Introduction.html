    <h1>Application Style Guide</h1>

    <p>This application style guide was created by the designers at
       Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  The guide covers the general design
       principles as well as specific design guidlines.  You'll also find
       downloadable assets for the basic elements of the appliation style.
       These are meant to help designers quickly begin designing applications
       based on these styles and patterns.  Finally, we've also created a
       web-based development platform that enables developers to quickly begin
       implementing enterprise applications.</p>
