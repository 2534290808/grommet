    <h2>Best Practices</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Let the user take control</dt>
      <dd>Provide ways for users to experience work with purpose, joy
      and efficiency by eliminating their pain points and allow them
      to craft their experience.</dd>

      <dt>Content over chrome</dt>
      <dd>You can have a gorgeous interface but if your content is hidden
      or the interactions are clumsy you are missing the point. Focus on
      the things that will deliver the greatest value to your customer.</dd>

      <dt>Don’t drown the user in data</dt>
      <dd>Carefully choose what you present to your users. If there is
      too much information available they will become overwhelmed and will
      likely abandon the experience.</dd>

      <dt>Product uniqueness while maintaining brand alignment</dt>
      <dd>Let your innovation shine through but remember that your product
      will be used by users who are using other products from HP.  You don’t
      want your application to feel or behave different in the core areas
      of navigation and interaction.</dd>

      <dt>Consistency across the application</dt>
      <dd>Use common controls, fonts and color scheme throughout your
      application. Customers like repetition and are comfortable with
      repeat patterns. This assures them that they are doing things
      correctly.</dd>

      <dt>Remember mobile first</dt>
      <dd>Designing for mobile first is very beneficial even if your
      main focus is not on mobile. Doing so can help eliminate non-essential
      information while reinforcing the most important information.</dd>

      <dt>Tell a story</dt>
      <dd>Stories are irresistible to human beings. Telling a story will
      help people connect with your product. Craft the user experience and
      add meaning to what can be done with your application.</dd>

      <dt>Tie in to existing mental models</dt>
      <dd>Mental models are schemes, images or representations of how we
      perceive and understand things. Use this concept to leverage the user
      knowledge on how your feature, control, and application works.</dd>

      <dt>Align with conventions, resist re-creating the wheel</dt>
      <dd>Be conscious about the correct time to innovate and the time to
      use existent design patterns.</dd>

      <dt>There are no user errors</dt>
      <dd>Do not let your users feel guilty about anything that happens
      inside your application. Use a friendly voice for system errors and
      take accountability for the interruption. Never blame the customer.</dd>

      <dt>You are not your application’s user</dt>
      <dd>Designers and developers can be described as advanced or
      “superusers” who are aware of every detail of an application that often
      leading to a detached perspective of an authentic user experience.</dd>

      <dt>All users are not the same</dt>
      <dd>Different users have different goals and each individual has a
      set of previous experiences that are relative to your application.</dd>

      <dt>Think about the entire user experience, beyond the UI</dt>
      <dd>Understand how your customers will interact with your product.
      Talk with different users to understand all the touchpoints.
      Consider creating a user journey for each persona. Share this
      deliverable with the whole team to leverage the impact of each
      person’s role in the project, increasing individual ownership
      and commitment.</dd>

  <section id="usability">
    <h2>Usability</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Focus on the task at hand</dt>
      <dd>Do not create distractions that won’t contribute to the task that
      your user is dealing with.</dd>

      <dt>Use progressive disclosure to create depth of content</dt>
      <dd>Do not clutter the interface with elements that do not make
      sense at that moment. Present the minimum required for a given task
      then grow the experience from there.</dd>

      <dt>People don’t read, they scan</dt>
      <dd>In user interfaces, massive amounts of text are usually
      treated as blocks of irrelevant information. If you want people
      to be aware of your content user short phrases or bullet points
      instead or highlight important data with proper styling.</dd>

      <dt>Tutorials vs. contextual help</dt>
      <dd>Well designed tutorials enable your user to remember how the
      feature works and will need less hand holding while navigating
      through your interface.</dd>

      <dt>Span form factors</dt>
      <dd>Expect your application to be used by multiple types of
      device and environmental conditions.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section id="interactions">
    <h2>Interactions</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Use device appropriate gestures and interactions</dt>
      <dd>Users expect interfaces to work naturally on their device.
      Delight your users by providing the expected interactions for
      the device they are using.</dd>

      <dt>Animate to ease and explain transitions and aid discovery</dt>
      <dd>Animations should be natural and reinforce the user’s
      interaction with  your application.  They should not be distracting
      or disruptive.</dd>
    </dl>

  <section id="mobile">
    <h2>Mobile</h2>

    <p>Mobile is not just different screen sizes. Mobile devices actually
    change the fundamental user user experience of common tasks. Embrace
    the devices and their native capabilities.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Consider new use cases</dt>
      <dd>What are the scenarios where people will be using your
      application outside of the traditional desktop environment?
      Reevaluate the need to have some features and capabilities
      designed for smaller screens. Take advantage of the capabilities
      that mobile devices have to offer such as a camera and notifications
      when designing your application.</dd>

      <dt>New devices sizes</dt>
      <dd>Do not plan your designs with a specific and unique
      resolution in mind. Consider that new devices are launched through
      the year. The more fluid your design is the better your
      application will behave, regardless the resolution and density of
      the screen.</dd>

      <dt>New device capabilities: GPS, camera, accelerometer, etc.</dt>
      <dd>You can use these new capabilities to implement features that
      requires geo positioning and location. Use the device orientation
      to provide a different view of the same screen or some related data.</dd>

      <dt>Gestures</dt>
      <dd>Users become accustomed to gesture support on their platform.
      Swiping, pinching, zooming, and even multi-finger gestures are
      becoming commonplace in mobile applications.</dd>

      <dt>Larger target areas</dt>
      <dd>A fingertip is less precise than a mouse pointer therefore
      needs a larger target. When designing for mobile remember to
      increase the size of buttons, form elements and controls.</dd>

      <dt>No hover</dt>
      <dd>Without the capacity to hover elements on a touch screen,
      be careful about the type of information or interaction that
      you associate with this action on the desktop version.</dd>

      <dt>Animate transitions but watch out for performance issues</dt>
      <dd>Transitions can be a delightful detail when you’re using an
      application, but consider that your design may be experienced on
      devices with drastically different hardware. What looks like a
      crafted detail in one device may turn into an annoying experience
      in another.</dd>

      <dt>A desktop experience is not a mobile experience</dt>
      <dd>Consider the context in which people will be using your
      application. Desktop and mobile experiences are far from seamless.
      For example, if you have a secondary feature that is composed
      of several steps and interactions, you may leave this experience
      for the desktop version only.</dd>

      <dt>Selection is preferred over input controls</dt>
      <dd>It is much easier to select a value from a pre-populated
      list than it is to input a value into a field using a (virtual)
      keyboard.</dd>

      <dt>Stay tuned</dt>
      <dd>Styling for native mobile applications will added to this
      guide in the near future.</dd>

  <section id="accessibility">
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>

    <p>Why does accessibility matter? Happier users, increased revenue,
    and universal access. For people with disabilities, being empowered
    with independent access to your application can provide a delightful
    sense of freedom. Basically, providing an accessible tool is the right
    thing to do for our users, and for our business.</p>

    <p>In general, we follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
    version 2.0. If you follow the HP Application Style Guide, your
    application will satisfy many aspects of the WCAG.</p>

    <p>At least, you should pay attention to three essential things:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Write good code. A well-written, semantic code is the essence
      of accessibility. It’s your primary mission. Consider accessibility
      since the first days of development, it will make your life easier
      and your users will be grateful. Trust us. ;)</li>

      <li>Use the elements as they were built to be used. Use buttons as
      buttons (triggering an action, activating a behavior), links as
      links (to lead users to another document), put label in all elements
      and use alternative text for images.</li>

      <li>Enable all functionalities for keyboard control. Make sure that
      the navigation order is intuitive and logical, use focus indicators
      and try to avoid non-navigable elements.</li>
